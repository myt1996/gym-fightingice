# gym-fightingice

Official gym API for game FightingICE for FightingICE 4.30.
See https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/Gym-FightingICE for FightingICE 4.40+.


See http://www.ice.ci.ritsumei.ac.jp/~ftgaic/ for more information about FightingICE and the AI Competition.

4 envs can be used:

FightingiceDataNoFrameskip-v0 <br />
FightingiceDataFrameskip-v0 <br />
FightingiceDisplayNoFrameskip-v0 <br />
FightingiceDisplayFrameskip-v0

In the above first two envs whose names contain "Data", a vector of game data with a delay of 15 frames is returned for obs (the state variables). <br />
In the above last two envs whose names contain "Display", an ndarray with no frame delay is returned for obs, but FightingICE will run slower in this mode. <br />
In the above second and fourth envs whose names contain "Frameskip", after an env.step(action) is called, obs at the timing right after the action's key inputs are completed will be returned. <br />

In addition to the above four envs, another env called FightingiceEnv_TwoPlayer is available that can be used to play a game between two gym-fightingice AIs. You can use this env to test the performance when you have two AIs developed in gym API.

# Requirement

gym to make env. Simply run
```bash
$ pip install gym
```
Or see gym official https://gym.openai.com/ and github https://github.com/openai/gym for more information.
<br /><br />

Java and py4j: to run the FightingICE Java version, please install Java by yourself; for py4j, run
```bash
$ pip install py4j
``` 
<br />

port_for: to select port automatically if needed, run
```bash
$ pip install port_for
``` 
<br />

opencv for python: to get obs if the "Display" mode is needed, run
```bash
$ pip install opencv-python
``` 
<br /><br />

# Install
First, clone this repo and run the following command in the same path where "setup.py" is.
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```
<br />
Then, download FightingICE from http://www.ice.ci.ritsumei.ac.jp/~ftgaic/index-2.html and extract it. The "FTGx.xx" folder should be specified in java_env_path below. <br />

# Usage
Set java_env_path when calling gym.make(), for example:
```python
env = gym.make("FightingiceDataNoFrameskip-v0", java_env_path="/home/your_user_name/FTG4.30")
``` 
or start your script in the FightingICE installed path or just change the defualt value in the source code.

Set the opponent AI when calling env.reset(), for example:
```python
env.reset(p2=Machete)
``` 
p2 can be an AI python class or a string for the name of an AI Java class. 
The AI Java class should be in a jar file and located in the lib folder under the FightingICE Java env.
